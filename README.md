### Course Outline
In this course, you'll learn the basics of deep neural networks and how to build various models using PyTorch. You'll get hands-on experience building state-of-the-art deep learning models.

### 1. Introduction to Neural Networks
* Learn the concepts behind deep learning and how we train deep neural networks with backpropagation.
### 2. Talking PyTorch with Soumith Chintala
* Cezanne Camacho and Soumith Chintala, the creator of PyTorch, chat about the past, present, and future of PyTorch.
### 3. Introduction to PyTorch
* Learn how to build deep neural networks with PyTorch
* Build a state-of-the-art model using a pre-trained network that classifies cat and dog images
### 4. Convolutional Neural Networks
* Here you'll learn about convolutional neural networks, powerful architectures for solving computer vision problems.
* Build and train an image classifier from scratch to classify dog breeds.
### 5. Style Transfer
* Use a trained network to transfer the style of one image to another image
* Implement the style transfer model from [Gatys et al](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576).
### 6. Recurrent Neural Networks
* Learn how to use recurrent neural networks to learn from sequences of data such as time series
* Build a recurrent network that learns from text and generates new text one character at a time
### 7. Sentiment Prediction with an RNN
* Build and train a recurrent network that can classify the sentiment of movie reviews
### 8. Deploying PyTorch Models
* Learn how to use PyTorch's Hybrid Frontend to convert models from Python to C++ for use in production
